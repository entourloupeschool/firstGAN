Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this repository, I've been working with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Python. The code and notebooks present in this repository are based on the tutorial available at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/generative-adversarial-networks/).

One of the main observations during this project has been the difficulty in tuning GANs. GANs are composed of two neural networks - the generator and the discriminator - that are trained simultaneously. This process can be quite challenging for a couple of reasons:

1 . Balancing the Training: One of the trickiest aspects to manage is keeping the generator and discriminator in balance. If either the discriminator becomes too powerful or the generator lags behind in its ability to fool the discriminator, the GAN can end up not learning properly.

2 . Mode Collapse: This is a situation where the generator starts to produce limited variety of outputs (even a single output), making it incapable of representing the full range of the data distribution. It's a common issue in GAN training and requires careful tuning and monitoring to prevent.

3 . Hyperparameter Tuning: Like any other machine learning model, GANs require thoughtful selection of hyperparameters. However, due to the dynamic nature of GAN training, the optimal set of hyperparameters can be harder to find and may require more extensive exploration.

4 . Evaluation of Results: Unlike other models where we have well-defined metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.), GANs do not have a straightforward metric to measure the quality of generated samples which makes the tuning process even more challenging.

It is clear that mastering GANs requires a deep understanding of the model's behavior and a lot of patience. However, the results can be truly impressive, as GANs are capable of generating very realistic images, music, and even texts.
